# jbpm-demos

Hello Geeks,

Vikas here, I like jBPM and Drools Technology which is mainly from the perspective of Business User.

This technology has really solved the problem which almost all developers were faced, which was that to understand the client requirement.

Now when jBPM come into market, developers start working closely with business needs. First, Business Alanlyst will define the flow through UI and represent to business and then developer will strat working on requirement.

This repositories is the master repository for all the jBPM and Drools demos.
